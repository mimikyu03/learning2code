# learning2code
Tracking my progress as I learn to code.

I am a current (6/1/2022) a Freshman in college, teaching myself how to code, before I pursue computer science in the coming years.
This repository will function as my portfolio from the time I am learning to code to the time I am more adept at it.
The goal is to show off my work, as well as show potential employers and schools my dedication and improvement over time.


Thanks for your time!
